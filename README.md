# menus.h

menus.h is a C library that gives easy access to cursor control and a some extra stuff. <br>
I've tried to make the library as self-explanatory and easy to read as I could. <br><br>

A long time ago when I was young and naive (about a year ago) and didn't know much about C and was just getting to learn it, I saw this awesome game called Nethack. <br>
Now I didn't know how to play Nethack and couldn't bother learning it so I decided to make my own Nethack game, this turned out to be way harder than I could ever imagine. <br>
First of all I had to install a library to be able to do these kind of things in the terminal, so I did my research and found out about curses/ncurses, well long story short, I failed to install curses and somehow stumbled upon this fun little library on github called conio.h.<br>
But it was way too cluttered for my taste and was even made in C++ (I know, such a dissapointment). So I made my own version of it, and here we are, about a year later in my files and I stumbled across this, it surprisingly still holds up.<br>
Well I just decided to share this someone ever wanted to do the same as I wanted a year ago (I was never able to make Nethack D:)<br>
